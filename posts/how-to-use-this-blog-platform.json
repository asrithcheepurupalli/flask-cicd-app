  "content": "# How to Use This Blog Platform\r\n\r\nThis blog is built to be simple and fully under control. No distractions, no unnecessary features \u2014 just a clean space to write, edit, and publish posts in Markdown.\r\n\r\n## Creating a Post\r\n\r\n- Click on \"New Post\" in the navigation bar.\r\n- Enter a title and your content in Markdown.\r\n- Press \"Publish\" to save the post.\r\n- The post gets stored as a JSON file inside the `/posts/` folder.\r\n\r\n## Editing or Deleting\r\n\r\n- Open any post and you'll see options to edit or delete it.\r\n- The editor provides live Markdown preview using SimpleMDE.\r\n- When edited, the original post file is updated in place.\r\n\r\n## Dark Mode\r\n\r\n- Click the \"Toggle Dark\" button in the header.\r\n- The site will switch between light and dark themes.\r\n- Your preference is remembered across sessions.\r\n\r\n## Tag Filtering\r\n\r\n- You can add tags to your posts using the input field.\r\n- Tags appear under the post title.\r\n- Click on a tag to see only posts with that tag.\r\n\r\n## RSS Feed\r\n\r\n- You can subscribe using the `/rss.xml` feed.\r\n- It includes all posts with their titles, content, and links.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis setup is intentionally minimal so you can modify it however you like. It runs on Flask, Markdown, and plain files \u2014 no databases or login systems. Just a writing tool that works.\r\n\r\nCheck the GitHub repo if you want to fork it or build your own version.",

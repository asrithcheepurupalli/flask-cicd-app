I build them because I need them.\r\n\r\nWhether it\u2019s a CLI to remind me of deadlines, a Telegram bot to talk to myself, or a full-blown dashboard \u2014 I ship it because I want to use it.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s how I learn. That\u2019s how I stick with it. I don't need 10,000 users. I just need it to work."

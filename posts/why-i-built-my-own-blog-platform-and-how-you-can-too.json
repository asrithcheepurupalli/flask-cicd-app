  "content": "# Why I Built My Own Blog Platform (And How You Can Too)\r\n\r\nI've always loved writing and building things just for myself. So instead of signing up for Medium or Hashnode, I decided to make my own blogging platform \u2014 simple, clean, and fully under my control.\r\n\r\nThis blog runs on Flask, uses Markdown for writing, and generates an RSS feed. I wanted something that felt like *mine*, from the folder structure to the publish button.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s what I learned while building it:\r\n- Creating a local-first Markdown editor with SimpleMDE is fun and fast.\r\n- JSON storage works great for small projects (no need for a database yet).\r\n- CI/CD makes it feel real \u2014 deploying with GitHub Actions taught me more than any tutorial.\r\n\r\nI also added features I actually care about:\r\n- Clean timeline\r\n- Dark mode toggle\r\n- Tag filtering\r\n- Edit/Delete without needing an admin panel\r\n\r\nWould I recommend it? Definitely. Not just because it\u2019s \u201ccool to build your own\u201d \u2014 but because the process teaches you exactly how the web works.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n###  Tech Stack:\r\n- Flask (Python)\r\n- Markdown + SimpleMDE\r\n- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)\r\n- HTML + CSS (handcrafted)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou can find the source code [on my GitHub](https://github.com/asrithcheepurupalli).\r\n\r\nIf you're curious, just fork it and try it out.",

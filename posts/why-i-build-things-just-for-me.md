title: Why I Build Things Just for Me
---

Some people build side projects to impress. I build them because I need them.

Whether it’s a CLI to remind me of deadlines, a Telegram bot to talk to myself, or a full-blown dashboard — I ship it because I want to use it.

That’s how I learn. That’s how I stick with it. I don't need 10,000 users. I just need it to work.

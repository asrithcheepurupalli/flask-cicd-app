title: Just Marking What I Watched
---

I used to forget what I watched and what I liked. So I made a basic web app to log it.

No ratings, no reviews, just a date, title, and whether I'd rewatch it.

Feels weirdly satisfying to have my own little archive instead of relying on Netflix’s “Continue Watching” bar.
